# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3Summary by Marissa GonzalesZinsser examines the bastardization of the written English language in these chapters.  Today, there is more “fuzz” in sentences than meaningful content.  This is to make language sound more important than it is. Writing is not easy; it takes work to be a skilled writer. To write sentences more concise, cut out the clutter.   Zinsser suggests, “Don’t dialogue when you can just talk.” Students should put brackets around useless words; it will train them to avoid using them at all.
